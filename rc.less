" VIM RC to be used so VIM act as a replacement for less.
"
" Put it in ~/.vim/rc.less.
"
" To replace less if you use ZSH, put this in your ~/.zshrc:
"
" less()
" {
"   if [ $# -eq 0 ]
"   then
"     view -u ~/.vim/rc.less -
"   else
"     view -u ~/.vim/rc.less "$@"
"   fi
" }
"
" And this to use VIM as a pager when calling man:
"
" export MANPAGER="sh -c 'col -x -b | view -u ~/.vim/rc.less -c \"set ft=man\" -'"
"

source ~/.vimrc
